# Agri-Food Notebook CO2 Emissions
## Research Topic
This repository contains the Python notebook developed for the thesis titled: **"Forecasting CO2 Emissions in Agriculture: Machine Learning Approaches Using Agri-Food Performance Data."**

The thesis investigates the performance of various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Feedforward Neural Networks. Additionally, the research emphasizes the importance of features within the dataset through PGI2 scores and examines the impact of feature selection on the models' performance.

## Libraries and Modules
The following libraries and frameworks were used for implementing machine learning models, feature analysis, and data preprocessing:

1. **[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)**  
   Used for:
   - Machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines).
   - Feature importance analysis and evaluation metrics.
   - Hyperparameter tuning using `BayesSearchCV`.

2. **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)**  
   Utilized for numerical computations and array manipulations.

3. **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)**  
   Used for data preprocessing, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis.

4. **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)**  
   Applied for creating visualizations such as scatter plots, scree plots, and feature correlations.

5. **[Scikit-Optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/)**  
   Employed for Bayesian optimization of model hyperparameters.

6. **[Scikit-learn's MLPRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor.html)**  
   - Used to implement the Feedforward Neural Network (FNN).
   - Includes backpropagation training and support for multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation.

7. **Python (Anaconda Distribution)**  
   Version: 3.11.4 (Anaconda distribution) was used for all computational tasks.

## Dataset
The original dataset used in this thesis is publicly available on Kaggle:
